# Stilson's Moog Filter (JUCE) 
A C++ class implementing Stilson's Moog Filter. Built within/for the JUCE framework.

- This is an entire JUCE project built around testing the filter. The relevant files are StilsonMoogFilter.h and StilsonMoogFilter.cpp

- The code for the filter was based on the following post from musicdsp.org :
  - https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/Filters/145-stilson-s-moog-filter-code.html
  
- Running the test/example application would require a JUCE installation on your machine
- Adding the filter to your project is as simple as dragging StilsonMoogFilter.h and StilsonMoogFilter.cpp into your own JUCE project via Projucer
